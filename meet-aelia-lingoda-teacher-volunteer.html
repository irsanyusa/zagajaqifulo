In this week’s ‘Meet the Teacher series, we are focusing&nbsp;on German! We’ve already met <span><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erika</a></strong></span> and <span><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura</a> </strong></span>who are German teachers, as well As <span><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brita</a> </strong></span>a Lingoda Teacher and blog writer. Now say hello to Aeila. Who can speak German, French and English!</p><h2><b>Aelia</b><b>, please tell us a little about yourself!</b></h2><p><span>Well, my name is Aelia Charles and I was born and raised in Austria, in a beautiful city called Innsbruck. At home we spoke French, as my dad is from France. Last year I moved there and I finished my University study.&nbsp; </span><span>I am a very new German teacher for Lingoda but I already like a lot.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Besides my work for <span><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lingoda</a> </strong></span>I also volunteer for social work as a teacher here in France.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC_7461-1024x678.jpg></p><h3><b>What does the average day look like for you as a Lingoda teacher?</b></h3><p><span>I like to start my day early. I have sometimes a class at 7am so I prepare myself the day before. Coffee helps! </span><span>I realised that my students are concentrated and participate during the course, which keeps me motivated as well.</span></p><h3><b>What is it that you like the most about the platform?</b></h3><p><span>I am very thankful that Lingoda provides the script and the curriculum for us, as I never have the same students and the same levels of language. I can save a lot of time and energy by this provision. </span><span>Furthermore, I appreciate the Lingoda Teachers Team who are interactive, friendly and courteous.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6055-1024x1024.jpeg></p><h3><b>Aelia, what is it about learning and speaking other languages that you enjoy?</b></h3><p><span>Language can be a barrier, especially if you live in a country whose language you don’t understand. My students have different motives but helping them to understand German will help them in their daily life and they will more easily adapt themselves. </span><span>I was raised by a loving Dad who had to learn German. I know it’s not easy but the advantages to be able to communicate well, to understand the person and it’s culture and thinking better, are obvious.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If you speak more than one language you can expand your horizon and get new experiences which will be beneficial for your whole life.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Why do you think people should learn languages?</b></h3><p><span>I love to travel. But speaking another language can have other benefits as well. Being able to speak another language opens possibilities, such as travelling, doing business and meeting new people from all over the world. Additionally, as already mentioned, it will expand your horizon and enable you to see things differently, from another perception which will be a rich blessing for your life.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2402897a-0162-4024-b329-389ed37edccb-683x1024.jpg></p><h3><b>What do you like most about the German language?</b></h3><p><span>I think German and its culture are well-structured, interesting and rich. Even though there are many Grammar rules, there are not many exceptions which helps not to get frustrated while learning. </span><span>German language is very rich of expressions, metaphors and words. Mostly I love the assembly of vocabulary to create a new word. It could be seen like a puzzle game!</span></p><h3><b>Why do you think people should visit, or even live in an German speaking country?</b></h3><p><span>Every German-speaking country differs from another. They offer different <span><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dialects</a></strong></span>, histories, political systems and landscapes. Nevertheless Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein are known to be very structured and well-organised countries which attract tourists from all over the world. </span><span>Every one of them has much to offer when it comes to culture and politics, and a rich historical background. They are known for (mostly classical) music, unique poems, sport activities and beautiful landscapes.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><b>If you had any tips or advice for a language learner, what would they be?</b></h4><p><span>Every beginning is hard but don’t forget: studying can be fun. </span><span>Go to tandem coffee shops and get to know German speakers. Communicate regularly with them and try your best especially at the beginning to understand the Grammar rules. </span><span>If you can, try to visit the country, so you’ll get an idea about the culture and the history.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><b>Aelia, what words of wisdom do you have for anyone who may be thinking about taking the leap into language learning?</b><span><br></span></h4><li><span>Learn how to study.</span></li><li><span>Get to know what strategy works the best for YOU.</span></li><li><span>We are all different. We don’t approach a language the same way and pace and we are all individuals who need to find their best way to study and to have fun doing so.</span></li><li><span>Find a nice and quiet place to review what you have learned and to practice diligently.</span></li><li><span>My best advice: travel! </span>Visit and get to know us, our <span><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">culture</a></strong></span>, food and see the beautiful country sides of German-speaking countries.</li><p>If you’d like to learn German with teachers like Aelia, sign up for a free 7 day trial with Lingoda. You can take part in classes around your schedule, from the comfort of your own home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Lingoda Team</h2><p>This article was produced by one of the in-house Lingoda writers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXNoKadmV6YvK57waWmoGeVo3yuscStZJqdnJ6ubrjIp56onJFiwaatwqGcq2WmpLm2utOenKtn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./melissa-gilbert-moves-from-la-to-a-catskills-house-battling-mice-and-mold-for-a-new-home-816312.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Melissa Gilbert Moves From LA to a Catskills House, Battling Mice and Mold for a New Home">&larr;
