The man sounded very angry, and there was a&nbsp;reason for&nbsp;it. His whole <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> wanted him to&nbsp;give his house to&nbsp;his brother, and the people whom he&nbsp;thought were his nearest and dearest, are now literally trying to&nbsp;kick him out of&nbsp;his own hard-earned property.</p><p><h2>The man’s story has a&nbsp;very troublesome beginning.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d17/ba9/5399b7535ba9d92850720ce552.jpg><p>A&nbsp;single man in&nbsp;his early 30s is&nbsp;currently <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>facing</a> an&nbsp;appalling behavior from the side of&nbsp;his parents and brother. The man wrote that his brother is&nbsp;29, and he’s already got four <a href=# title=kids data-link=tag>kids</a> now. He&nbsp;had his first at&nbsp;22, and the second followed a&nbsp;year later. Then the third two years after that. And the fourth is&nbsp;the most recently born, a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;months ago.</p><p>His wife (the man’s SIL) and the man do&nbsp;not get along, as&nbsp;she always likes to&nbsp;try and get a&nbsp;rise out of&nbsp;him by&nbsp;acting superior. Then turns into an&nbsp;extreme self-victimizing drama queen if&nbsp;he&nbsp;retaliated against her in&nbsp;any way.</p><p>The man describes her manners, saying, “She can cry in&nbsp;an&nbsp;instant and can put on&nbsp;an&nbsp;extremely convincing show to&nbsp;get sympathy from just about anyone. My&nbsp;parents and brother absolutely adore her, even though they know exactly how she really is&nbsp;and just don’t care. She’s very good-looking, I’ll give her that. But she’s so&nbsp;awful that&nbsp;I could never be&nbsp;attracted to&nbsp;her. She also refuses to&nbsp;get any sort of&nbsp;<a href=# title=job data-link=tag>job</a>, even though she has a&nbsp;college degree and my&nbsp;mother willingly helps with the kids all day.”</p><p>So&nbsp;his brother’s family finances are entirely dependent on&nbsp;his brother. This also means they can’t afford to&nbsp;live anywhere but their parents’ house. And privacy is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;an&nbsp;issue with all of&nbsp;them under one roof in&nbsp;a&nbsp;three-bedroom house that was built in&nbsp;the 60s.</p><p><h2>The man has never seen any love and care from his family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b9/106/32c1b359f0bffaad8753329411.jpg><p>The man continues his story, saying that growing&nbsp;up, his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>younger</a> brother was also the obvious favorite. They’re three years apart in&nbsp;age, but he&nbsp;developed a&nbsp;superiority complex because the older brother was badly punished if&nbsp;he&nbsp;retaliated against his antics in&nbsp;any way back then. It&nbsp;was obvious that their parents cared for him a&nbsp;lot more because he&nbsp;got the lion’s share of&nbsp;everything unless people called them out on&nbsp;it. Which did happen a&nbsp;fair bit by&nbsp;other members of&nbsp;family. Which is&nbsp;why their parents packed them all up&nbsp;and moved them about a&nbsp;hundred and fifty miles away from them, so&nbsp;they generally only would only see them on&nbsp;holidays, since it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;three-hour drive.</p><p>The man’s brother got physically violent towards him on&nbsp;a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;occasions, flirted relentlessly with his first girlfriend to&nbsp;the point she broke up&nbsp;with the&nbsp;OP, and laughed at&nbsp;any misfortune he&nbsp;had. And their parents just told the&nbsp;OP to&nbsp;suck it&nbsp;up&nbsp;whenever he&nbsp;was upset about&nbsp;it. He&nbsp;only got equal treatment when their parents wanted to&nbsp;keep up&nbsp;appearances.</p><p>The man wrote, “I&nbsp;admit it&nbsp;was rather funny to&nbsp;see the looks on&nbsp;their faces whenever they had to&nbsp;treat me&nbsp;equal to&nbsp;my&nbsp;brother on&nbsp;birthdays and <a href=# title=Christmas data-link=tag>Christmas</a> because other people were present. We&nbsp;had relatives that were very nosy, and <a href=# title=loved data-link=tag>loved</a> gossiping drama. So&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents did their best to&nbsp;hide what was really going&nbsp;on, and threatened to&nbsp;take all my&nbsp;stuff away if&nbsp;I didn’t keep my&nbsp;mouth shut. If&nbsp;anything, it&nbsp;just made my&nbsp;parents celebrate more when&nbsp;I turned 18&nbsp;and moved out because it&nbsp;meant they no&nbsp;longer had to&nbsp;provide for&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;wasn’t even done with high-school yet when&nbsp;I moved out.”</p><p>But couch-surfing was far better for the man than living with parents. He&nbsp;was low contact ever since leaving home. They didn’t even show up&nbsp;for his high school graduation. From that point&nbsp;on, the man would usually only see his parents and brother on&nbsp;holidays, like the rest of&nbsp;the family.</p><p><h2>The problem of&nbsp;family accommodation has made things even worse for everyone.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/54a/831/affe97545889d2ab3cca9a21a9.jpg><p>Due to&nbsp;the loss of&nbsp;his job and tough financial <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>situation</a>, the&nbsp;OP appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;homeless. He&nbsp;wrote, “I&nbsp;own a&nbsp;truck simply for the fact that I’ve always loved trucks, so&nbsp;I found a&nbsp;$1000 camper in&nbsp;good shape and put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;my&nbsp;truck just so&nbsp;I could live out of&nbsp;it&nbsp;for a&nbsp;while. It&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;temporary. But I&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;living out of&nbsp;it&nbsp;far longer than&nbsp;I ever thought. I&nbsp;originally was hoping to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;live out of&nbsp;the camper at&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents’ house, where my&nbsp;brother and his family still reside as&nbsp;well.”</p><p>His parents weren’t going to&nbsp;support him at&nbsp;that hard times. The man explained, “But when&nbsp;I asked my&nbsp;parents to&nbsp;let me&nbsp;stay for a&nbsp;while, they told me&nbsp;they had a&nbsp;full house, and didn’t want me&nbsp;there. Plus, we&nbsp;hadn’t exactly gotten along in&nbsp;the past decade. They said they’d only agree to&nbsp;let me&nbsp;park my&nbsp;camper there if&nbsp;I paid them basically what it’d cost to&nbsp;rent an&nbsp;apartment in&nbsp;my&nbsp;area. That was way too much just to&nbsp;park my&nbsp;camper.”</p><p>“I&nbsp;was jobless and trying to&nbsp;save as&nbsp;much of&nbsp;my&nbsp;unemployment money as&nbsp;I could till&nbsp;I could find a&nbsp;new job. I&nbsp;may as&nbsp;well be&nbsp;living in&nbsp;an&nbsp;apartment with that rent price they were asking. My&nbsp;parents called my&nbsp;camper an&nbsp;eyesore and told me&nbsp;to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;hike since we&nbsp;couldn’t come to&nbsp;an&nbsp;agreement. And SIL thought it&nbsp;was absolutely hilarious&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;camper. My&nbsp;brother joined her in&nbsp;pointing at&nbsp;and mocking me&nbsp;while calling me&nbsp;names.”</p><p><h2>The man was able to&nbsp;survive through hardships and bought his house.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/878/2e5/b178425af6b1691e0facb058de.jpg><p>After a&nbsp;long time of&nbsp;living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;camper, the&nbsp;OP was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>finally</a> able to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;better job, a&nbsp;higher payment, and could afford to&nbsp;buy a&nbsp;house.</p><p>He&nbsp;revealed, “I&nbsp;looked around for something close to&nbsp;my&nbsp;work, and just two miles away found a&nbsp;three bedroom manufactured home on&nbsp;a&nbsp;small property. But I&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;get it&nbsp;for $10K less than the asking price somehow. I&nbsp;used nearly my&nbsp;entire savings for a&nbsp;down payment and got approved for a&nbsp;home loan. I&nbsp;finally didn’t have to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;camper anymore. There was enough space for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;back my&nbsp;truck in&nbsp;behind the house to&nbsp;take the camper off to&nbsp;set it&nbsp;up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the back yard. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;put it&nbsp;there as&nbsp;it’s own little building, just in&nbsp;case&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;use it&nbsp;again.”</p><p>And from then&nbsp;on, he&nbsp;started to&nbsp;witness a&nbsp;real fight for his property, arranged by&nbsp;his parents and his brother.</p><p><h2>The man’s entitled family wants to&nbsp;take everything off from him.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e4/b8b/b8b0ad52e18e63e4231835c083.jpg><p>The man <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>described</a> his family members’ reaction, saying, “When I&nbsp;was fully settled in&nbsp;the house, I&nbsp;was dumb enough to&nbsp;brag about it&nbsp;on&nbsp;my&nbsp;book of&nbsp;faces. My&nbsp;family saw the post, and that’s where this really starts. After a&nbsp;few weeks, my&nbsp;parents and brother along with his family came to&nbsp;visit completely unannounced to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;tour of&nbsp;my&nbsp;home.”</p><p>“I&nbsp;didn’t even give them my&nbsp;address. So&nbsp;how they found out where I&nbsp;live, I&nbsp;still don’t know. None of&nbsp;my&nbsp;friends have fessed&nbsp;up, and no&nbsp;prior family members visited me&nbsp;before that. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;wonder if&nbsp;they stalked me&nbsp;at&nbsp;work and followed me&nbsp;home or&nbsp;something. It&nbsp;really wouldn’t surprise&nbsp;me.”</p><p>Then, the whole family went even further. The OP&nbsp;wrote, “Once I&nbsp;opened the door, they practically all shoved their way in&nbsp;like rambunctious tourists. Then just started making themselves at&nbsp;home. They all kept poking around and SIL had this creepy smirk that she was repeatedly flashing&nbsp;me. And it&nbsp;was only later that&nbsp;I figured out why. And it&nbsp;made me&nbsp;madder than a&nbsp;bull on&nbsp;steroids that just got stung by&nbsp;a&nbsp;hornet.”</p><p>“My&nbsp;parents were constantly talking about how I’ve got so&nbsp;much extra space now. And it’s too much for someone like me&nbsp;who has no&nbsp;wife or&nbsp;kids. (Sure, not now. But maybe someday) And my&nbsp;brother kept remarking about how there was more space than our parents’ house, and my&nbsp;house was closer to&nbsp;his job too.”</p><p><h2>The tension in&nbsp;the family is&nbsp;not at&nbsp;its peak.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/544/d11/ae64755dff820fb152141213cb.jpg><p>If you let your mean, spoiled brother move into your house with his 4 kids and nasty wife you are crazy!</p><p>One day, the man witnessed something that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>made</a> him totally mad. He&nbsp;wrote, “I&nbsp;came home later that week on&nbsp;Friday evening to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;moving truck and my&nbsp;brother’s minivan parked in&nbsp;my&nbsp;driveway. It&nbsp;was Dan and his family there moving stuff&nbsp;in. He&nbsp;just waved to&nbsp;me&nbsp;with a&nbsp;grin when&nbsp;I saw him. I&nbsp;was furious and told him and the rest of&nbsp;his family to&nbsp;stop. But SIL smugly said to&nbsp;me&nbsp;that like it&nbsp;or&nbsp;not, they were moving&nbsp;in. And then in&nbsp;the most fake way while tilting her head and puckering her lips, she said that it&nbsp;was&nbsp;ok, because my&nbsp;mommy allowed&nbsp;it. And I&nbsp;should always listen to&nbsp;what my&nbsp;mommy tells&nbsp;me.”</p><p>The man describes his emotions, saying, “I&nbsp;seethed with rage just hearing those words and looking at&nbsp;her face. So&nbsp;locked myself in&nbsp;my&nbsp;truck to&nbsp;call the cops right away. When they realized what&nbsp;I was doing, SIL started pounding on&nbsp;my&nbsp;window and yelling at&nbsp;me&nbsp;to&nbsp;stop. And that&nbsp;I can’t do&nbsp;this to&nbsp;her because she and Dan need the house.”</p><p>His whole family are convinced that he&nbsp;must give his house to&nbsp;his brother now. The man goes on&nbsp;with the dramatic details, saying, “My&nbsp;SIL&nbsp;cried, ‘<strong>Why can’t you just do&nbsp;this for Dan!?</strong>’ I&nbsp;responded with, ‘<strong>Why, Dan! It’s my&nbsp;house! Not his!</strong>’. Then she threatened to&nbsp;key the side of&nbsp;my&nbsp;truck unless&nbsp;I stopped calling the police. All of&nbsp;which the 911 operator heard thanks to&nbsp;the window being slightly open. I&nbsp;told SIL&nbsp;if she damaged my&nbsp;truck, I’d sue her. And she was smart enough to&nbsp;retreat.”</p><p>The man sums up&nbsp;his post, saying, that after the police were called, they all were angry and tried to&nbsp;guilt him. He&nbsp;made them leave and publicly exposed his parents, and now the entire rest of&nbsp;the family is&nbsp;on&nbsp;his side, and his parents are utterly destroyed about&nbsp;it.</p><p>And here’s yet another family dilemma. A&nbsp;woman had to&nbsp;kick her <a href=#>pregnant daughter</a> out from the house, together with her 6&nbsp;kids.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ec%2BaqZ6mpKh6qrrSoqqtZZliura%2F02aeoq6VYrq6eceorKydXam8brnYZpmrp6SdsrN5wZ6amq2jmnqquYysoKefnJp6orrDZp%2BeZZiWwG6tjJ%2BYpqGcrnp5fZZuam9n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./3-easy-ways-to-get-a-bigger-bottom-and-wider-hips-naturally.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="3 easy ways to get a bigger bottom and wider hips, naturally">&larr;
