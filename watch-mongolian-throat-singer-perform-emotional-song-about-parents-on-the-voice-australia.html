He performed an original song called “Mother and Father” with his handmade horse fiddle in 2020. You need to check out his Blind Audition below that will seriously take you on a spiritual journey.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bukhu-ganburged-brought-mongolian-throat-singing-to-the-voice-australia><strong>Bukhu Ganburged</strong> Brought Mongolian Throat Singing To ‘The Voice Australia’</h2><p>The beginning of Bukhu’s performance just started out with the endearing sound of the horse fiddle. The coaches sat with their eyes closed listening to each and every note. Once the Mongolian artist started singing, Boy George, Kelly Rowland and Guy Sebastian all turned their chairs. Delta Goodrem finally turned her chair making this one incredible four-chair turn. He then began doing some traditional throat singing which had the coach’s jaws on the floor.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>THIS ICONIC ‘AGT’ STAR COMPETED ON ‘THE VOICE AUSTRALIA’ TWICE — WHAT IS HE DOING NOW?</a></strong></p><p>Everyone stood on their feet to give Bukhu a standing ovation. He chose to be on Team Guy. “Thank you, everyone, for your lovely words of support and encouragement,” he wrote in the comments section of his audition video. “It means a lot to me and I am glad my music has touched so many people. I wrote this song for my mother and father, but I would now like to dedicate it to all parents around the world.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-coaches-had-a-huge-conflict-during-his-performance-in-the-battles>The Coaches Had A Huge Conflict During His Performance In The Battles</h3><p>Fans of the show could not wait to see what Bukhu was going to do in The Battles. However, they were left extremely disappointed by his coach, Guy. He was put up against Johnny Manuel singing “Earth Song.” However, Bukhu barely got to sing two lines out of the whole song. It was pretty much a solo performance for Johnny as Bukhu stood and played the horse fiddle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teirwLyO3nk</p></figure><p>Kelly and Delta called Guy out for not giving Bukhu an equal opportunity. Kelly literally walked off the set because he did not really get to sing at all in the song. It is a singing competition after all. Johnny was chosen as the winner of The Battle and the dynamic became awkward between the coaches.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>STREET PERFORMER GETS HIS BIG BREAK WITH 4 CHAIR TURN ON ‘THE VOICE AUSTRALIA’</a></strong></p><p>Guy went backstage to comfort both artists after the conflict between the coaches. Fans feel Bukhu was totally robbed of an opportunity to showcase his voice. “Guy did Bukhu so dirty. I was so disappointed Bukhu wasn’t given any chance in the ‘battles.’ A loss of such amazing talent” one fan wrote in the comments section.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-bukhu-ganburged-now>Where Is <strong>Bukhu Ganburged</strong> Now?</h3><p>After he was sent home on The Voice Australia, Bukhu spoke out about his dramatic elimination. “I’m actually really happy with that ending, it’s a good experience,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he told Daily Mail.</a> He actually felt like Guy does not deserve to be criticized for the song choice and decisions he made during The Battles.</p><p>“I’m just so happy with my past because I’ve already set up my music career and don’t really care about [The Voice]” he said. For him, being on the show was all about getting more exposure for his music and getting his name out there. Guy also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">put out a public apology</a> to both the artists and his fellow coaches.</p><p>Bukhu continues to post videos on his YouTube channel that you should definitely go check out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>WATCH 18-YEAR-OLD OVERCOME STUTTER TO GIVE DYNAMITE PERFORMANCE ON ‘THE VOICE AUSTRALIA’</a></strong></p><p>Do you think Bukhu was robbed on The Voice Australia?</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Voice-of-Greece.jpeg alt="Singer Stuns ‘The Voice’ With A Rock Cover Of Michael Jackson [VIDEO]" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice Australia</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571pqrnKBdoryvs86loJqmXam1s7vArWSsoZ6csrN5z56pn6eionqmuc6toKimkaF6tLvNoGSamp%2BqwW68wKucp6yjYryvedOhnGaun56wpnnArqqtqpGhtqJ7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./12-stylish-ways-to-wear-a-sweater-without-sacrificing-your-comfort-810289.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="12 Stylish Ways to Wear a Sweater Without Sacrificing Your Comfort">&larr;
