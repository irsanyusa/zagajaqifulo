But after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recent racist comments surfaced</a>, it looked like his career was taking a turn for the worst. Still, his fans have stuck by him leading him to break a major Billboard record.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-morgan-wallen-rose-to-fame-after-competing-on-the-voice>Morgan Wallen Rose To Fame After Competing On ‘The Voice’</h2><p>Wallen grew up in Tennessee and began singing at the age of 3. After winning a singing competition when he was 8 years old, Wallen was offered a recording contract. However, his mother wanted him to have a normal childhood and turned down the deal. He also planned to pursue a college baseball career but an injury put an end to that dream. This is when Wallen realized that he wanted to be a singer.</p><p>For his Blind Audition on The Voice in 2014, Wallen performed “Collide” by Howie Day. Shakira turned her chair almost immediately. Usher also turned his chair. They both agreed that Wallen’s voice is unique. It was during Wallen’s audition that Adam Levine sat on Blake Shelton’s lap and watched Shakira and Usher fight over him. Wallen chose to be on Team Usher.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FIRST LOOK AT THE NEW CONTESTANTS ON ‘THE VOICE’ SEASON 20</a></strong></p><p>In The Battles, Wallen went up against Brothers Walker singing “Hey Brother.” He was chosen to move on in the competition. In the second round of The Battles, he was stolen by Levine. He was eliminated in The Playoffs stage of the competition after his performance of “Stay.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>After appearing on The Voice, Wallen signed with Panacea Records in 2015. He released his EP called Stand Alone&nbsp;and eventually signed with Big Loud Records.&nbsp;After releasing numerous singles including “The Way I Talk,” Wallen was invited on tour with country duo Florida Georgia Line.</p><p>In 2018, Wallen’s debut album If I Know Me proved to be a major success on the charts. His single “Whiskey Glasses” reached the top spot on Country Airplay. The album eventually topped the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Top Country Albums chart</a> with smash singles “Up Down” and “Chasin’ You.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wallen-found-himself-in-several-controversies-over-the-past-year>Wallen Found Himself In Several Controversies Over The Past Year</h3><p>In May 2020, Wallen was arrested outside of a Nashville bar for public intoxication and disorderly conduct. He reportedly had broken glass inside of the bar which got him kicked out and led to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">drunken confrontations with passersby.</a> After appearing in court, Wallen did not face any further repercussions from the incident.</p><p>He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">put out an apology</a> on Twitter. “I went out downtown last night with a few old friends. After a couple bar stops, we were horse-playing with each other. We didn’t mean any harm, and we want to say sorry to any bar staff or anyone that was affected” he wrote. “Thank you to the local authorities for being so professional and doing their job with class. Love y’all.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WATCH ‘THE VOICE’ COACHES CELEBRATE 10 YEARS OF THE SHOW IN EPIC WAY</a></strong></p><p>Just a few months later in October 2020, Wallen was set to make his debut performing on Saturday Night Live. Videos surfaced of the country star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">disregarding social distancing rules</a> amid the coronavirus pandemic. His performance was later postponed due to his violation of the safety protocols in place.

It did not disappoint after topping the Billboard 200. He landed the cover of Billboard Magazine. The 27-year-old made history as the first artist to have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>six songs in the Top 10</a> of&nbsp;Hot Country Songs&nbsp;at the same time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>However, in February 2020, Wallen was seen on video <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hurling a racial slur </a>at one of his friends. This had some major consequences because Big Loud Records announced it has suspended his recording contract indefinitely.&nbsp;</p><p>His music has been removed from the iHeartMedia&nbsp;rotation along with Cumulus Media’s playlists. He was not in Spotify’s Hot Country playlist or Apple Music’s Today’s Country Playlist. CMT and the Country Music Association also announced they were going to be removing Wallen’s appearances from all platforms. His latest album will not be eligible at the&nbsp;56th Annual&nbsp;Academy of Country Music Awards.
