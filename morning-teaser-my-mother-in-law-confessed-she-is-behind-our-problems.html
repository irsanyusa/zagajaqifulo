We always gave Ebuka's mother everything she wanted but I noticed that she was partial and liked some of her children more than the rest.</p><p>She didn't like my husband even though he was very nice to her and even transferred that hatred to me and my four children. I was worried because I considered myself as the most respectful daughter-in-law among her daughters-in-law.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Whenever she visited us, I gave her the biggest meat, plenty food, the most comfortable bed and much more but she would go to the village and tell lies that I maltreated her.</p><p>who is my husband's elder brother had been living with us in our house and I did not have any objection to that. Nduka is the mother's favourite and everything he did got her approval.</p><p>He even brought his girlfriend to live with us. The girl caused so much trouble in my house and caused a fight one day where she wanted to beat me up. But instead of scolding her, my mother-in-law supported her.</p><p>Ebuka was forced to ask his mother why she supported evil when she knew it was wrong. In reply, she said that she would make life difficult for us though we thought she was joking or making an empty threat till things took a turn for the worse for us.</p><p>A few years later, we both lost our jobs and shortly after, Ebuka and my eldest child became very sick. I had to sell all our properties to buy their drugs and pay the hospital bill. We relocated to a one bedroom apartment.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>You can't begin to imagine how much we suffered. We had to beg before we could get food to eat. After selling all our properties, Ebuka and my child got well and all through that period, his mother did not visit us.</p><p>She started living with Nduka who had become very rich by now. One night, I sat on the bed, looked at my life and cried so much because that was not how my family and I were supposed to live.</p><p>We who used to be landlord and landlady of duplexes and storey buildings, were now tenants in a one bedroom apartment.</p><p>We had no option but to seek God's face and decided to go for deliverance for two weeks. After we were done with the deliverance, we received a call that Ebuka's mother was shouting that she was on fire and wanted to see us so that she would make a confession.</p><p>We didn't go to meet her but they were really serious as they brought her to meet us in the compound. There, she confessed that she transferred Ebuka's glory to Nduka, made us lose our jobs, caused the sickness that afflicted Ebuka and my first born to make us sell all our properties.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>She also confessed to doing so many bad things. The evil things that she had done to us were too much to pen down and now she is begging for forgiveness.</p><p>I don't know if Ebuka will forgive her but I don't think that I will forgive her for making us suffer because her son didn't marry a woman from their tribe.</p><p>Please, I want you to advise me. What should I do?</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Dear readers, we have another story of how wicked a mother could be to her own son and daughter-in-law. On Morning Teaser today, we want you to weigh in and advise Bolu on what to do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02ikqKqenruoedOemKydomK6unnMqKuhnaJitq95y5quZpufo7Omv9Kem2armJp6qr%2BMm5yhoZ6ZerDB0Wanq6eSobKuv45wsK2pqZ29</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./benoist-apparu-veut-un-horizon-degage-pour-lanah.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Benoist Apparu veut un horizon dgag pour l'Anah">&larr;
