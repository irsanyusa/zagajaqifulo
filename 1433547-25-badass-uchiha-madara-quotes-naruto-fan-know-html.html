Everyone in the community admired his strength and <a href=#>leadership skills</a>. He often shared important life lessons with his people. These teachings are useful in the life of every human being.</p><ul><li>Be strong enough to be someone who even the demons would fear.</li><li>I’d be lying if I said things are going according to my plan, but beggars can’t be choosers, right?</li><li>The concept of hope is nothing more than giving up.

If you are facing rough times or uncertainty in life, you should read badass Madara quotes to keep you going.</p><ul><li>You have the best gift you can have, life.</li><li>Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this world. The longer you live, the more you realize that in this reality only pain, suffering and futility exist.</li><li>In this world, wherever there is light – there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winners exists, there must also be losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars, and hatred is born to protect love.</li><li>Human beings are nothing but a medium of the general process of carrying out life. They do want to live in peace, but want to win it over by war because ultimately victory is what brings them peace.</li><li>Man seeks peace, yet at the same time yearning for war… Those are the two realms belonging solely to man. Thinking of peace whilst spilling blood is something that only humans could do. They’re two sides of the same coin… to protect something… another must be sacrificed.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/73bffc95a37314e9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best Uncle Iroh quotes from Avatar: The Last Airbender</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3e7234699f36a1be.png><h2>Madara Uchiha quotes about love</h2><p class=align-left>Who did Madara love?
