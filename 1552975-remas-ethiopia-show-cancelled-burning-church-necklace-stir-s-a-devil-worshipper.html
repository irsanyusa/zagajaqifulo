Father Michael</h2><p class=align-left>According to a Nigerian reverend, Father Michael Olayemi, who shared his thoughts with Legit.ng on Rema’s cancelled Ethiopian show, men continue to showcase their freedom to the point of not paying attention to some virtues. He explained that the religious institution is under attack.</p><p class=align-left>He said:</p>“The modern man continues to emphasise freedom to the extent that he never pays attention to certain traditional truths and virtues. In the bid to satisfy his urges and desires, He invents certain things and thinks less of the impact on others. There is no doubt that religion as an institution is seriously under attack these days as many continue to question the reason for a union between a man and a "supposed" supreme being up there.”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d7b8b48d32e0dde6.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Isreal DMW’s wife spotted without wedding ring in new photos, fans react to marriage crash rumours: “Na true?”</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Not stopping there, he went ahead to speak on how signs and symbols are used in many religions to portray certain truths and people should not be indifferent to these symbols.</p><p class=align-left>He also stated that because man is free, they say they are free to do anything because God says one should not judge. Father Michael noted that this school of thought makes many people silent in their bid to practise religious tolerance.</p><p class=align-left>He said:</p>“Signs and symbols remain a veritable tool used in almost all religions to portray certain truths and teach very important lessons. This is why we cannot be indifferent to signs and symbols used in our house of worship. However, the mindset of the modern man creeps in as we tend to say that we are free to wear anything, do what we like or say what we please as we worship God. Some would justify their recklessness and wrong choices by saying that we are not God to judge what they do or wear. These seeming attacks on the norm often drive many of us to silence that we fail to speak when need be. In the bit of religious tolerance, we have become receptive to all kinds of evil in our religious institutions.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/551caa6a7fe027f8.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Portable storms fueling station and pays for everybody’s fuel, video causes stir: “He has a good heart”</span></p></a>As the bible notes "The devil is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for who to devour" (1Pet. 5:9) This means that the devil does not stop in his mission to get as many followers as possible, we are the one to up our games, know our values and live by them come rain, come sunshine.”<h2>The move by the Ethiopian government is a loud one</h2><p class=align-left>Father Michael also spoke on Ethiopia’s decision to cancel the Nigerian singer’s show. According to him, it is a loud statement that shows where they stand when it comes to religion.</p><p class=align-left>He said:</p>“The move of the Ethiopian government to cancel such a show because of a certain necklace that bears a church building and the cross turned upside down is a loud statement that speaks volumes about where they stand when it comes to religion. There is nothing of the necklace that shows reverence for the divine and if a show can be cancelled for such, then the country makes clear that no one would come to desecrate their land or disorient their wards. We cannot keep bringing everything into religion, there is a clear-cut boundary that we must uphold. If we do not make a statement about our stance on certain issues, there is a tendency that everything will be allowed. Jesus would drive out the people from the temple because He needed to make a statement about the sacredness of the temple (cf. Mt. 21:12ff).”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3d9e48587f3ee82c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Davido’s billionaire dad goes to passport office for capturing, fans react to viral photos: “He no join queue”</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Father Michael also noted that a necklace with an upside down burning church is an offensive thing to religious sensitive people and it would immediately make them not interested in what it’s being associated with.</p><p class=align-left>In his words:</p>“Every music or entertainment has a focus and we see this in the lyrics employed, the videos adopted, the contents and other things employed. Without any prejudice to creativity, you can tell what the music tries to portray from listening and watching. Hence, as an individual or community, our interest would determine the kind/type of music we employ. To religious sensitive people, a necklace with a burning church and an upside down cross is offensive which outrightly makes such people unintrested. St. Paul says "Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you" (2Cor. 6:14-17).”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0f67be8c51616615.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Pastor Adeboye predicts Naira will bounce back, stronger than dollar soon, Nigerians react</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On a final note, Father Michael commended the move of the Ethiopian people to stand by what they believe in.</p>“The move of the Ethiopian people is a noble and very commendable step for what they stand for”, he said.<h2>How Rema threw shade at Burna Boy at Headies Award</h2><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>Mavin star clinched three awards</a>, beating Burna Boy to be crowned the African Artist of the Year, Digital Artist of the Year and Best Male Artist of the Year.</p><p class=align-left>During the award ceremony, Rema gave a winner's speech that stirred reactions.</p><p class=align-left>Some fans noted that his speech was a dig aimed at his senior colleague Burna Boy.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZqbWVnhniBjKucppmjYrK1tMiop6KZXai1sMOMnJinm5WhuaawjJusq6aZo7Rur8euqZygXaOypLfLmpqeZaOptrN50maYZpyVq7atedaoqaygmaW9pr6O</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./these-are-the-best-nollywood-movies-of-2024-so-far.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="These are the best Nollywood movies of 2024 so far">&larr;
