Some insiders say Lopez was pretty upset, while others think she might have been okay with&nbsp;it. Despite rumors of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Jennifer Lopez" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lopez</a> trying to&nbsp;patch things up&nbsp;with Jennifer Garner, it&nbsp;seems like there’s some conflict between the singer and <a href=# title="Ben Affleck" data-link=tag>Ben Affleck</a>.</p><p><h2>Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have been meeting up&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot lately, and it’s been getting quite intimate.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a3d/20e/35cea2568d97d8618c263ec16e.jpg><p>KELA/Broadimage/Broad Image/East News<span>, </span>KELA/Broadimage/Broad Image/East News</p><p>Recently the actor had a&nbsp;very “family” meeting with his kids and ex-wife, and pictures of&nbsp;their encounter melted everyone’s hearts. But they also caused quite a&nbsp;stir.</p><p>Ben Affleck couldn’t hide his grin when he&nbsp;met up&nbsp;with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner and their three kids in&nbsp;beautiful Florence, Italy. He&nbsp;arrived in&nbsp;style on&nbsp;a&nbsp;private jet, and as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;he&nbsp;stepped off, his face lit up&nbsp;with joy. The actor was thrilled to&nbsp;see Jennifer and the kids, and their warm hug didn’t go&nbsp;unnoticed.</p><p>Some even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>say</a> Ben looks happier than ever, and there’s definitely been a&nbsp;noticeable change in&nbsp;his behavior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/385/943/d469ac533485d8e7b4210d4ee1.jpg><p>Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck were recently spotted in&nbsp;a&nbsp;car together with their 14-year-old daughter, Seraphina. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>photos</a> captured a&nbsp;heartwarming moment when they shared a&nbsp;warm embrace inside the vehicle, exchanging smiles and seemingly reconnecting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;personal level.</p><p>These pictures quickly made their way around the internet, and people had all sorts of&nbsp;opinions. Some folks were quick to&nbsp;criticize Jennifer Garner, calling her a&nbsp;“<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>homewrecker</a>” and hinting that Ben Affleck might be&nbsp;cheating on&nbsp;his current wife, Jennifer Lopez.</p><p>But <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>others</a> took a&nbsp;more laid-back view of&nbsp;the situation, pointing out that co-parenting is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real thing, and Ben has every right to&nbsp;spend time with his ex&nbsp;when their child is&nbsp;involved. They also noted that the pictures didn’t show anything scandalous—just Jennifer Garner in&nbsp;the back seat, not the front.</p><p><h2>Ben also gave his ex-wife a&nbsp;ride two weeks after.</h2></p><p></p><p>Affleck was recently seen having what seemed like a&nbsp;“close moment” with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner. They were caught on&nbsp;camera hanging out in&nbsp;Santa Monica, California, this past Tuesday. They seemed to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;quick chat before Jennifer Garner jumped into her ex-husband’s car for a&nbsp;ride.</p><p>We’re left in&nbsp;the dark about where the <i>Daredevil</i> co-stars were off to&nbsp;this time.</p><p>This relaxed meet-up happened just <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>two weeks</a> after the former couple made headlines for getting cozy in&nbsp;the same car, leaving everyone wondering what’s going on&nbsp;with them.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;“heated argument” between J.&nbsp;Lo&nbsp;and Affleck sparked a&nbsp;debated discussion.</h2></p><p></p><p>Adding to&nbsp;the drama, Affleck being spotted sharing what seemed like an&nbsp;“intimate moment” with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner, has led many to&nbsp;wonder if&nbsp;there’s a&nbsp;connection between these events or&nbsp;if&nbsp;it’s just a&nbsp;coincidence.</p><p>Their recent relationship <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>drama</a> centers around photos of&nbsp;them having what the media is&nbsp;calling a&nbsp;“heated discussion” inside their car while cruising around Los Angeles. These pics have set off a&nbsp;frenzy of&nbsp;gossip online, with fans and media outlets alike speculating about what they were arguing about and whether things are rocky between them as&nbsp;they approach their one-year wedding anniversary.</p><p>In&nbsp;the pictures, you can see Affleck gesturing passionately while talking to&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Lo. Neither the <i>Argo</i> director nor his wife look too thrilled during this intense car moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/101/bd2/1b5bcd57a3baeb25b4103a829a.jpg><p>Despite all the buzz and attention, fans of&nbsp;the couple have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rallied</a> behind them on&nbsp;social media, seeing their actions as&nbsp;totally normal for a&nbsp;married couple. Supporters were quick to&nbsp;point out that “a&nbsp;married couple having a&nbsp;tiff in&nbsp;their car” is&nbsp;nothing to&nbsp;write about. As&nbsp;one fan wisely put&nbsp;it, “They’re human. People fight. Get over&nbsp;it.”</p><p>Like any couple, Ben and Jennifer have their disagreements. The public’s obsession with their every move can blow these private moments out of&nbsp;proportion. Other than this, it’s now very well-known the stable and caring relationship J.&nbsp;Lo&nbsp;has set with Jennifer Garner. The 54-year-old singer seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;all in&nbsp;for her husband’s friendly relationship with Garner, putting all of&nbsp;her efforts to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;work and co-parent their kids.</p><p><h2>Their public fights have been more frequent. Sources say J.&nbsp;Lo&nbsp;is&nbsp;jealous of&nbsp;Garner and Ben’s strong connection.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/427/cd5/b38af956f68e4c4a698f15710b.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the premiere of&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Lo’s new movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Mother</i></a>, the reunited couple looked a&nbsp;bit down on&nbsp;the <a href=# title="red carpet" data-link=tag>red carpet</a>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>People</a> said Jennifer Lopez was frowning and gesturing at&nbsp;her husband, who seemed pretty upset.</p><p>When Jennifer Garner was seen hugging Ben Affleck intimately, Jennifer Lopez reportedly got a&nbsp;bit jealous of&nbsp;their strong connection. According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>source</a>, “The jealousy J.&nbsp;Lo&nbsp;feels over their deep connection is&nbsp;intense. She believes Ben lied to&nbsp;her about his friendship with Jen&nbsp;— their bond is&nbsp;stronger today than when they were married&nbsp;— and she let Jen know she doesn’t appreciate how much of&nbsp;her husband’s time Jen has been taking&nbsp;up. They’re currently in&nbsp;a&nbsp;big fight over Ben.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b23/65a/78b1d456fc9c1ad8c0c86cd190.jpg><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, earlier this year, there were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reports</a> that Jennifer Lopez was trying to&nbsp;mend her relationship with Jennifer Garner because she thought it&nbsp;could help her marriage to&nbsp;Ben Affleck. A&nbsp;source in&nbsp;June even said, “J.&nbsp;Lo&nbsp;has realized that Jen will always be&nbsp;a&nbsp;big part of&nbsp;Ben’s life. Even if&nbsp;they’re not married, he&nbsp;still values Jen’s opinion and respects her.”</p><p>She simply didn’t want to&nbsp;fight with Ben anymore and just wanted peace and harmony in&nbsp;her relationship. And, despite Jennifer Lopez’s discomfort, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, who have three kids together, still have a&nbsp;close bond.</p><p>However, it’s important to&nbsp;remember that celebrity events or&nbsp;even “open fights” may often stir up&nbsp;gossip, and what we&nbsp;see in&nbsp;public might not tell the whole story about their relationship.</p><p>This isn’t the first time we’ve seen J.&nbsp;Lo&nbsp;and Ben Affleck having a&nbsp;<a href=#>heated</a> argument on&nbsp;camera; they’ve had a&nbsp;few heated public disputes in&nbsp;recent months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK%2BmuoyapZ1lmmK5sL%2BMppirqpmWtKZ50q2pmqGeqHqiucidqq1lmJ7Abr7EnJynrF2eu7W1zJqrnmWdmrK1tc2gqmavmam1brbEp6WinpWneqit0aecq2VoZoJ5f49o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rsa-jeunes-dernier-inventaire-avant-liquidation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="dernier inventaire avant liquidation ?">&larr;
