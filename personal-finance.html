It offers interest-free financing, an opportunity to build credit, and can be used to shop at hundreds of brands, with flexible repayment options.</p><h2 id=how-does-sezzle-work>How does Sezzle work?</h2><p>Sezzle allows you to make purchases at its partner merchants and pay for them over time. Once you download the Sezzle app, you can shop online or in stores directly from the app. You can also set up a Sezzle Virtual Card that is accessible through your digital wallet.</p><p>There are four ways to pay with Sezzle.</p><ul><li><strong>Pay in full.</strong> By paying in full, upfront, you won’t pay interest or make any ongoing payments.</li><li><strong>Pay in 2</strong>. Pay in 2 allows you to make two payments over two weeks with no interest charged.</li><li><strong>Pay in 4.</strong> With Pay in 4, you make four payments over six weeks without interest.</li><li><strong>Pay monthly.</strong> You can choose to pay off Sezzle purchases over three to 48 months with interest. Lender approval is required.</li></ul><p>Note that Sezzle requires a down payment of 25% of the purchase price.</p><p>Sezzle Up allows you to build credit with purchases. To enroll, you'll need to:</p><ul><li>Pay off one purchase in full and on time.</li><li>Link a bank account as your primary payment method.</li><li>Verify your Social Security number.</li></ul><p>Once you are enrolled, your Sezzle payment history can be reported to the <a rel=alternate href=#>three main credit bureaus</a>. On-time payments can help you <a rel=alternate href=#>build your credit score</a>.</p><h2 id=who-is-sezzle-for>Who is Sezzle for?</h2><p>Sezzle is designed for people looking for a <a rel=alternate href=#>buy now, pay later app</a> that offers interest-free payments and an opportunity to build credit. You might choose Sezzle if you:</p><ul><li>Regularly shop online.</li><li>Want some flexibility in how you pay for purchases.</li><li>Would like to get a credit boost from what you spend.</li></ul><p>Sezzle is purely a buy now, pay later app. You can’t use it to transfer funds to friends and family or receive payments. For that, you might consider Cash App, which allows you to send and receive payments almost instantly.</p><h2 id=who-isnt-sezzle-for>Who isn’t Sezzle for?</h2><p>Sezzle—or any buy now, pay later app—may not be suitable for anyone who struggles with overspending or managing debt. While these apps can be a less expensive way to borrow than a credit card, they can also tempt you to spend.</p><p>Using more than one buy now, pay later app can complicate your budget if you’re juggling several payments simultaneously. Missed payments can trigger late fees, and you may be subject to overdraft fees from your bank if a buy now, pay later installment payment puts your account in the negative.</p><h2 id=sezzle-pros-and-cons>Sezzle: Pros and cons</h2><h3 class=title>Pros:</h3><ul><li>Pay off purchases in two or four installments with no interest charged</li><li>Build up credit history when you enroll in Sezzle Up</li><li>Shop hundreds of brands both online and in-store</li></ul><h3 class=title>Cons:</h3><ul><li>Monthly payment plans carry interest charges</li><li>Multiple fees may apply</li><li>Account upgrade required to unlock premium features</li></ul><h2 id=how-much-are-sezzle-fees>How much are Sezzle fees?</h2><p>Sezzle is not entirely free of fees. Here are four you might pay to use the app:</p><ul><li><strong>Late payment fee:</strong> Up to $15.</li><li><strong>Payment rescheduling fee:</strong> Up to $7.50.</li><li><strong>Convenience fee for credit or debit card payments:</strong> Up to $1.50.</li><li><strong>Failed payment fee:</strong> Up to $5.</li></ul><p>Again, your bank can also charge overdraft or nonsufficient funds fees if you schedule a payment that your Sezzle account balance can’t cover. Linking a bank account for payment and keeping track of your due dates can help you avoid these fees.</p><h2 id=how-does-sezzle-stack-up>How does Sezzle stack up?</h2><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1nbwfq1-1 iYXWdO not-prose"><tr class="wrapper__Tr-sc-1nbwfq1-4 oGfrp"></tr><tbody class="wrapper__Tbody-sc-1nbwfq1-5 kklmFK" readability=38><tr class=table-row readability=7><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p><strong>Payment options</strong></p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=5.5><p>Pay in full, pay in 2, pay in 4, and pay monthly</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Pay in 4 and pay monthly</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>Pay in 4 and pay over time</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Pay in 4 and pay monthly</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=3><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p><strong>Interest-free payments</strong></p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4.5><p>Yes, for pay in 2 and pay in 4</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Yes, for pay in 4</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Yes, for pay in 4</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Yes, for pay in 4</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p><strong>Down payment required</strong></p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=8><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p><strong>Impact to credit</strong></p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>Apply with no impact to credit; build credit with Sezzle Up</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>Apply with no impact on credit; late payments reported to credit bureaus</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>Apply with no impact to credit; late payments not reported to credit bureaus</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>Apply with no impact to credit; late payments reported to credit bureaus</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=8><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=5.5><p>Late fees, payment rescheduling fee, convenience fee, failed payment fee</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4.5><p>No late fees, no signup fees</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Sezzle vs. PayPal</h3><p>Sezzle offers multiple payment options, including a pay-in-full option and two interest-free installment plans. You can also pay off larger purchases with interest over up to 48 months.</p><p><a rel=alternate href=#>PayPal</a> offers an interest-free pay-in-4 option and monthly payment plans. You can choose a six-, 12-, or 24-month repayment term with no down payment required and no signup fees. PayPal charges a slightly higher maximum annual percentage rate (APR) than Sezzle, but it doesn’t charge late fees.</p><p>You can apply for Sezzle or PayPal without it <a rel=alternate href=#>affecting your credit scores</a>, but only Sezzle helps you build a credit history. Keep in mind that either one can report late payments to the credit bureaus.</p><h3>Sezzle vs. Afterpay</h3><p>Afterpay allows you to pay in four installments or choose a monthly payment plan. You can choose a six- or 12-month payment term, compared with up to 48 months with Sezzle.</p><p>Like Sezzle, you can apply for Afterpay without impacting your credit. However, it doesn’t help you build credit, as your payments are not reported to credit bureaus. However, Afterpay doesn’t report late payments either, so missing a due date won’t hurt your credit score.</p><p>Afterpay charges late fees, but the app will send you payment reminders to help you avoid them. Compared with Sezzle, you'll have more options for shopping, as Afterpay is accepted at thousands of top brands.</p><h3>Sezzle vs. Affirm</h3><p>Affirm also allows you to pay in four interest-free installments or choose a monthly payment plan. You can make three to 48 payments with interest, and the APR is slightly above what Sezzle charges.</p><p>You can apply without a hard credit check, and Affirm doesn’t impact your credit score unless you pay late. Like all of the buy now, pay later apps mentioned here, Affirm may require a down payment at checkout.</p><h2 id=where-does-sezzle-stand-out>Where does Sezzle stand out?</h2><p>Sezzle offers certain advantages over other buy now, pay later apps. They include:</p><ul><li>Interest-free pay in two payment plans.</li><li>Up to 48 months to pay (with interest).</li><li>Credit-building features.</li></ul><h3>Payment options</h3><p>Overall, Sezzle offers more flexibility with payments than other buy now, pay later apps. You’re not limited to paying in four installments; you can choose to pay in two if the purchase is smaller or you simply want to get a completed purchase under your belt to apply for Sezzle Up.</p><p>You can also pay in full if you don’t want to have ongoing payments. Doing so allows you to earn up to 2% back on eligible orders. You can spend up to $1,500 in a single transaction or up to $5,000 per month using the pay-in-full feature.</p><p>If you choose an interest payment plan, the APR range is a bit below what other apps charge. You’ll also be able to select a longer term than with other apps. Keep in mind, however, that a longer payment term can mean paying more interest total.</p><h3>Build credit</h3><p><a rel=alternate href=#>Establishing a credit score</a> is a huge plus for younger people, who may have no experience using credit yet. Enrolling in Sezzle Up is relatively easy, and there’s no fee to get started.</p><p>Again, however, you’ll need to make timely payments in order <a rel=alternate href=#>to see positive results</a>. Setting up payment reminders can keep you from falling behind and hurting your score.</p><h2 id=where-can-sezzle-improve>Where can Sezzle improve?</h2><p>Sezzle is lacking in certain areas, so knowing what to expect before getting started is helpful. Some of the biggest drawbacks of Sezzle include:</p><ul><li>Fees.</li><li>Transparency.</li><li>Refunds.</li></ul><h3>Fees</h3><p>As mentioned, Sezzle can charge late fees, convenience fees, failed payment fees, and payment rescheduling fees. Of course, if you always pay on time and your payments go through, you won’t have to worry about them.</p><p>Still, other buy now, pay later apps don’t charge them at all, so if you’re hoping to escape high fees, you might consider a different app.</p><h3>Transparency</h3><p>You may be wondering how much you can spend with interest-free installment plans and monthly plans. The answer is that it depends.</p><p>You need to create a Sezzle account to view your spending limits, so you may not know how much you can spend until you’re at the checkout trying to make a purchase.</p><p>Other apps publish their minimum and maximum limits online, making it easier to gauge spending power.</p><h3>Refunds</h3><p>Refunds can get tricky if you get money back from a merchant rather than Sezzle. In that case, you’ll still need to pay off your Sezzle installment plan. It’s not a huge hassle, but it’s still an extra step you’ll have to take to ensure you don’t owe anything to Sezzle for a canceled or refunded purchase.</p><h2 id=how-to-create-a-sezzle-account>How to create a Sezzle account</h2><p>You need to download the Sezzle app to sign up. You can do so via the Google Play Store or the App Store.</p><p>Once you’ve installed the app, follow the prompts to create your Sezzle account. Verify that you're 18 or older, enter your email address and phone number, and link a payment account. You can choose a standard Sezzle account or explore the Premium and Anywhere plans.</p><p>With Sezzle Premium, you can:</p><ul><li>Access exclusive deals and discounts.</li><li>Shop big-name brands.</li><li>Receive priority customer support.</li><li>Get one free extra payment reschedule per order.</li></ul><p>Note that if Sezzle Premium isn’t listed in the membership options under account settings in the app, you won’t be able to sign up. Sezzle Premium pricing is not disclosed online.</p><p>Sezzle Anywhere is available for U.S. shoppers only. It allows you to use a Sezzle Virtual Card with Google Pay or Apple Pay anywhere Visa is accepted.</p><p>You can sign up for Sezzle Anywhere in the app as long as it’s listed under the membership options. If approved, you get all the benefits of Sezzle Premium, including earning cash back on eligible purchases.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-approved-for-sezzle>How to get approved for Sezzle</h2><p>Sezzle doesn’t require a minimum credit score for approval. To use it you must:</p><ul><li>Be 18 or older (or 19 if you live in Alabama or are a ward of the state in Nebraska).</li><li>Have a U.S. mobile phone number that can receive text messages.</li><li>Have a valid email address.</li><li>Have an active U.S. bank account.</li></ul><p>Those guidelines apply to standard Sezzle accounts. The app doesn’t specify how it decides who is eligible for Premium or Anywhere accounts. Again, if you don't see them listed in your membership options, you won’t be able to upgrade your account.</p><h2 id=how-to-use-sezzle>How to use Sezzle</h2><p>To use Sezzle, select it as your payment method at checkout when shopping online at an eligible brand’s website. Choose a payment plan, then complete your order.</p><p>Again, you can pay in full, pay in two or four installments, or choose a monthly payment plan with interest. Once you’ve chosen a plan, you won’t be able to change it for that purchase.</p><p>If you’re shopping in a store, log into the Sezzle app and select "Make a purchase request" from the Virtual Card tab. Enter the amount you plan to spend, review credit terms, and use your Virtual Card at checkout.</p><h2 id=more-about-sezzle>More about Sezzle</h2><p>Curious about who’s behind Sezzle or where the company originated? Here’s a look behind the scenes.</p><h3>Who created Sezzle?</h3><p>Sezzle is the creation of Charlie Youakim, who co-founded the company in 2016 with Paul Paradis and Killian Brackey. Youakim is currently the executive chairman and CEO, while Paradis is the chief revenue officer. Brackey served as chief technology officer for the company from its founding until 2022.</p><p>Youakim is a serial entrepreneur with a fintech background. Paradis has a finance background with a focus on sales, marketing, and strategy.</p><h3>Who owns Sezzle?</h3><p>Sezzle does not have a single owner. Instead, the publicly traded company is owned by a mix of institutional investors, individual investors, and public companies. It trades on the Nasdaq using the ticker symbol SEZL.</p><h3>How to contact Sezzle</h3><p>Sezzle shopper support is available via email, secure messaging, and phone. You can also message Sezzle support through the mobile app 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p><p>If you want to talk to a human, you can call Sezzle at (888) 540-1867. Phone support is available from nine a.m. to five p.m. CST Monday through Friday.</p><h3>Is Sezzle safe?</h3><p>Sezzle uses multiple security measures to protect customer accounts and information, including:</p><ul><li>Real-time fraud monitoring and alerts.</li><li>Monitoring for unusual spending patterns and purchase activity.</li><li>Account freezes (when fraud is suspected).</li><li>Encrypted data.</li></ul><p>Nevertheless, Sezzle and other financial apps are always targets for hackers and identity thieves. Choosing a strong password, updating it regularly, and monitoring your account activity are all things you can do to protect yourself when shopping with Sezzle.</p><h2 id=time-stamp-sezzle-lets-you-spend-and-build-credit-at-your-own-pace>TIME Stamp: Sezzle lets you spend and build credit at your own pace</h2><p>Buy now, pay later apps such as Sezzle have transformed the way people shop online. If you’re considering using Sezzle, it helps to know how it works and what you’ll pay before deciding if it’s right for you.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Is there a catch to using Sezzle?</h3><p>No, as long as you are aware that you’ll pay interest if you choose a monthly payment plan. It’s also a good idea to review Sezzle’s fees, so you’re not surprised by any added charges.</p><h3>Does Sezzle hit your credit?</h3><p>You can apply for a Sezzle account without impacting your credit score. If you enroll in Sezzle Up, you can get on-time payments reported to the credit bureaus. However, Sezzle can also report late payments, which could hurt your credit, so it pays to keep track of your due dates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmapnaKovK%2Bty2adoqaRo7Cme8Crq6KbnJp8tLHZs6OeZaKaw6qx1mg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-moment-of-innocence-1200446876.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Moment of Innocence: Film Review">&larr;
