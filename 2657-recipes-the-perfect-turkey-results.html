Turkey with a Lincolnshire sausage-meat stuffing,</i></b><b> by 'Beverleyanne' from Grantham</b></h2><p data-block-key=v2j3m><b>Buy your turkey from your local butcher where possible:</b> “I like to know where it has come from, and that nothing has been added to it, such as water, and I don’t want it packaged in plastic or cellophane. My butcher knows exactly where it has come from – the local farms – and I know it hasn’t travelled half way around the world/country and been standing in some warehouse for god knows how long! Fresh is best.”</p><p data-block-key=yyl5f><b>To prepare:</b> I lift the skin on the breast gently, without perforating it, and 'shove' butter in it, trying to massage it as far as I can into the turkey breast, so as much of it is covered in butter as possible. I then smear butter on the outside as well, before covering it in streaky bacon. I also stuff it loosely both ends – one end with sausage-meat, and one with homemade parsley and thyme stuffing. I then wrap it very loosely in foil.</p><p data-block-key=9irbj><b>Create your stuffing:</b> I buy Lincolnshire sausage-meat from my butcher, and then I cut up some ready-to-cook chestnuts, or mash them with a fork, then add them to the sausage meat. I also buy a packet of parsley and thyme stuffing, and make it up according to the packet, but add plenty of fresh chopped parsley to it and a scattering of fresh breadcrumbs.</p><p data-block-key=w1bbq><b>Cooking times and temperatures:</b> Start if off at 180 ̊C (gas mark 4), for 3 hours, then 200 ̊C (gas mark 6) for 1 hour.</p><p data-block-key=vlp3c><b>Note:</b> Remove the foil from the top after one-and-a-half hours. Then I remove the bacon for the last 30-40 minutes. I also check the stuffing inside the bird, and if it is going to need longer, then I remove it into a bowl and cook it separately for the last 30 minutes.</p><p data-block-key=0os3u><b>Rest and serve:</b> After allowing the turkey to rest for 15 minutes, my husband carves it – just the breast, and we only have breast meat with Christmas dinner.</p><p data-block-key=vtz17><b>A family tip from the Grantham fold:</b> My mother and relatives before her used to cook the turkey starting the night before on a very low heat. I used to, until one night we forgot and put it in at 9am ready for a 2pm lunch (for a 12-15 lb turkey) This was just as good, if not better, and so have done this ever since – 4 hours is fine.</p><p data-block-key=873g1><b>Show/Hide the full recipe<br></b></p><h2 data-block-key=xhlq8><b><i>2. Marvellously moist upside-down turkey, by Pam LB, Bournemouth</i></b></h2><p data-block-key=6bawo><b>Go for a local, free range bird each Christmas:</b> "Our local free range turkeys have a lovely life, the end of which is quick and painless. Plus, we only have one a year.”</p><p data-block-key=su7k0><b>To prepare:</b> I rub oil, salt and pepper on the skin of the turkey, and put halved carrots and onion inside it. I then put stuffing over breast meat, beneath skin.</p><p data-block-key=cmr2q><b>Herby home-made stuffing recipe:</b> I use home-grown sage leaves, scalded and chopped, mixed with an egg and breadcrumbs and, the key ingredient, fried onions.</p><p data-block-key=pq1ly><b>Cooking times and temperatures:</b> Start off the turkey at 220 ̊C (gas mark 7) for 20 minutes, then lower the temperature to 170 ̊C (gas mark 3) for the remaining cooking time (3 hours and 50 minutes), and baste every 30 minutes.</p><p data-block-key=ijj0k><b>Leave your bird to stand, then carve:</b> Leave the turkey to stand upside down for at least half an hour. This allows the juices to flow through the breast meat too. Carving depends upon the number of guests, but I usually remove a leg and wing from one side and slice the leg, and then carve the breast meat from the same side.</p><p data-block-key=chbl7><b>For the gravy:</b> We also use the old-fashioned method of pouring the majority of turkey fat into a bowl, then loosening the contents of the roasting tin. Warm on a low heat, and add flour to make a roux. When cooked, we add stock, and then simmer. Taste, and add seasoning if required.</p><p data-block-key=42ryc><b>Show/Hide the full recipe<br></b></p><h2 data-block-key=889c0><b>3.</b><b><i>Turkey with a boozy bacon, sage & onion stuffing</i></b><b>, by Roger C, Stafford</b></h2><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Cranberries.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-block-key=l96jg><b>Buy your bird locally:</b> "A great way to support your client butcher".</p><p data-block-key=8hpnl><b>Prepare and stuff your turkey:</b> Ensure that all innards are removed.
