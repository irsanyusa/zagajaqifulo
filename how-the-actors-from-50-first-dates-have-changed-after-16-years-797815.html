Maybe one of&nbsp;the things that made it&nbsp;click with&nbsp;us was how much we&nbsp;admired Henry’s perseverance when pursuing Lucy. She woke up&nbsp;every morning believing it&nbsp;was October&nbsp;13, 2002 because she was suffering from amnesia, meaning that she had lost her memory after that day. Still, Henry didn’t give up&nbsp;and made every date unique until he&nbsp;made her fall in&nbsp;love with him time and time again, despite the fact that she wouldn’t remember him the next day.</p><p>After 16&nbsp;years, <strong>Bright Side</strong> thought that compiling some of&nbsp;the actor’s changes was a&nbsp;great way of&nbsp;paying tribute to&nbsp;this iconic rom-com. So&nbsp;let’s get to&nbsp;it! Check out what your favorite actors have been up&nbsp;to&nbsp;over the past few years.</p><p><h2>1. Adam Sandler as&nbsp;Henry Roth</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/80f/dda/f29b1d59f384b1c9cde6200804.jpg><p>The lead actor from this comedy is&nbsp;the iconic <a href=#>Adam Sandler</a>, who has starred in&nbsp;a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;Hollywood films that have made&nbsp;us laugh, cry, or&nbsp;both at&nbsp;the same time. During his career, Sandler has been involved in&nbsp;all aspects of&nbsp;film production. From helping screenwriters to&nbsp;develop their work to&nbsp;working as&nbsp;an&nbsp;executive producer in&nbsp;different shooting sessions, Sandler has proven his multifaceted approach to&nbsp;cinema. In&nbsp;1999&nbsp;he even founded his own production company called <a href=#>Happy Madison</a>.</p><p>At&nbsp;53, Sandler doesn’t seem to&nbsp;have aged much. In&nbsp;his spare time he&nbsp;likes to&nbsp;play <a href=#>music</a> and, after starring together with <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> in&nbsp;the popular <a href=# title=Netflix data-link=tag>Netflix</a> film Murder Mystery and shining in&nbsp;Uncut Gems, Sandler is&nbsp;now working on&nbsp;new film projects. In&nbsp;fact, he&nbsp;just signed a&nbsp;new <a href=#>contract</a> with Netflix to&nbsp;release 4&nbsp;new movies.</p><p><h2>2. Drew Barrymore as&nbsp;Lucy Whitmore</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8f4/ff2/e6568654909337e1b91db7d46d.jpg><p><a href=# title="Drew Barrymore" data-link=tag>Drew Barrymore</a>, 45, has had a&nbsp;great track record on&nbsp;the big screen since she started acting when she was just a&nbsp;kid. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;playing Lucy in&nbsp;50&nbsp;First Dates, she and <a href=# title="Adam Sandler" data-link=tag>Adam Sandler</a> have also made an&nbsp;excellent couple in&nbsp;other well-known romantic comedies like The Wedding Singer and Blended, which was <a href=#>produced</a> by&nbsp;Happy Madison.</p><p><br>Not only does Barrymore stand out in&nbsp;her role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;comedian, but later in&nbsp;her career she also <a href=#>proved</a> her versatility and talent as&nbsp;a&nbsp;director, producer, and even as&nbsp;a&nbsp;photographer. On&nbsp;her Instagram <a href=#>account</a>&nbsp;— with more than 13&nbsp;million followers&nbsp;— she shows her life and activities in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very natural way. She often uploads new videos to&nbsp;share anecdotes and everyday situations with her fans.</p><p><h2>3. Rob Schneider as&nbsp;Ula</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/602/996/6db3035d349e62ae103d9f035e.jpg><p>Rob Schneider, now&nbsp;56, began his career as&nbsp;a&nbsp;comedian while graduating from high school. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;generally <a href=#>known</a> for playing humorous characters. Schneider has never been without work and always manages to&nbsp;bring out smiles among fans. The last project he&nbsp;took part in&nbsp;was <a href=#>The Wrong Missy</a>, an&nbsp;American comedy that premiered on&nbsp;Netflix on&nbsp;May&nbsp;13, 2020, in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;plays a&nbsp;character named Komante.</p><p><h2>4. Sean Astin as&nbsp;Douglas ’Doug’ Whitmore</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/576/223/f770085641a83cf6615ce1f770.jpg><p>Sean Astin, 49, has also had a&nbsp;long and fruitful career in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;acting. He&nbsp;landed his <a href=#>first</a> acting role in&nbsp;1981 in&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV movie called Please Don’t Hit Me, Mom and from then on&nbsp;he’s hardly ever stopped working. One of&nbsp;his most important roles was of&nbsp;course in&nbsp;The Lord of&nbsp;the Rings trilogy (2001-2003), where he&nbsp;played one of&nbsp;the main characters, Sam, Frodo’s faithful friend and sidekick.</p><p><br>On&nbsp;his <a href=#>website</a>, Astin defines himself as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor, director, producer, runner, activist, writer, husband, and father. That’s because in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;acting, Astin has other passions, like being a&nbsp;long-distance marathon runner and he&nbsp;has also served as&nbsp;a&nbsp;board member of&nbsp;several non-profit organizations with the interest of&nbsp;raising awareness about <a href=# title="mental health" data-link=tag>mental health</a> and helping to&nbsp;promote civic engagement.</p><p><h2>5. Dan Aykroyd as&nbsp;Dr. Keats</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/755/fad/0cbacf50a08f805bcf418ae423.jpg><p>Dan Aykroyd, 67, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;Canadian writer, actor, singer, and screenwriter who, thanks to&nbsp;his many film roles, has become a&nbsp;renowned comedian. But just like any good actor, his versatility has led him to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;various projects and other film genres like <a href=#>drama</a>, which included the film Driving Miss Daisy, for example.</p><p>His latest project is&nbsp;still in&nbsp;the works&nbsp;— the highly anticipated <a href=#>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</a>, often referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;“Ghostbusters&nbsp;3,” where he&nbsp;plays Dr. Raymond Stantz. This film is&nbsp;intended to&nbsp;be&nbsp;released in&nbsp;March 2021. Besides acting, he&nbsp;has also stood out as&nbsp;a&nbsp;musician and has recorded many blues albums.</p><p><h2>6. Lusia Strus as&nbsp;Alexa</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6e9/70c/fc46c25f999a3139a61841a9c0.jpg><p>Lusia Strus, 50, was born in&nbsp;Chicago, but actually comes from a&nbsp;Ukrainian family. Her career has managed to&nbsp;successfully <a href=#>combine</a> theatre and film for almost 2&nbsp;decades. However, her most recognized role in&nbsp;the film industry remains precisely the one she played in&nbsp;50&nbsp;First Dates as&nbsp;Henry’s (Adam Sandler) eccentric assistant.</p><p><h2>7. Blake Clark as&nbsp;Marlin Whitmore</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c60/100/3841065869a2a3d219836fa788.jpg><p>Blake Clark, 74, has devoted himself to&nbsp;comedy and voice acting and has <a href=#>worked</a> on&nbsp;films like Toy Story 3&nbsp;and Toy Story&nbsp;4, where he&nbsp;voiced the dog, Slinky. It’s not uncommon to&nbsp;see him in&nbsp;other comedies that star Adam Sandler.</p><p><br>For the last 20&nbsp;years, Clark has been <a href=#>performing</a> in&nbsp;stand-up shows for different comedy clubs and on&nbsp;shows like The Tonight Show and many HBO comedy specials. In&nbsp;addition, he&nbsp;has made several special appearances and starred in&nbsp;over 50&nbsp;movies and&nbsp;TV shows.</p><p><h2>8. Amy Hill as&nbsp;Sue</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f44/bad/a7f7785fb4bdc26378a65f3611.jpg><p>Amy Hill, 67, is&nbsp;an&nbsp;American film and theater actress. She’s of&nbsp;Japanese and Finnish descent. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;live acting and performances (which were actually her main activity before entering Hollywood), she has also done voiceovers for various animated series and films <a href=#>like</a> Lilo &&nbsp;Stitch.</p><p>Currently, Hill is&nbsp;still up&nbsp;and running and appears regularly as&nbsp;Mama P&nbsp;on&nbsp;Amazon’s Just Add Magic. She also appears in&nbsp;the series Unreal where she plays Dr. Wagerstein, broadcast by&nbsp;the <a href=#>Lifetime</a> cable network and in&nbsp;the romantic comedy musical Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, as&nbsp;Lourdes Chan.</p><p><h2>9. Allen Covert as&nbsp;Ten-Second Tom</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d4/8d1/f51c2f5e0b97b808ed2e8fc624.jpg><p>Allen Covert, 55, is&nbsp;actually very <a href=#>close</a> to&nbsp;Adam Sandler in&nbsp;real life. They studied together in&nbsp;college and have not been apart since, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;has become common for Covert to&nbsp;partner with him on&nbsp;several of&nbsp;his productions. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;being a&nbsp;comedian, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;screenwriter and producer. In&nbsp;2006, Covert starred in&nbsp;the comedy Grandma’s Boy, produced by&nbsp;Sandler. This was his first (and only) leading role.</p><p>In&nbsp;recent years, Covert has not appeared in&nbsp;many films. However, he&nbsp;has been actively working behind the scenes for Adam Sandler’s production company, Happy Madison. There, he&nbsp;has undertaken many roles, starting off as&nbsp;a&nbsp;co-writer, to&nbsp;later become an&nbsp;executive producer and even a&nbsp;composer of&nbsp;original soundtracks for films.</p><p><h2>10. Maya Rudolph as&nbsp;Stacy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8ec/8d8/7b07d05afb8373ac7736a800b8.jpg><p><a href=#>Maya Rudolph</a>, 47, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;being an&nbsp;actress and comedian, is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;singer and vocal artist. For example, in&nbsp;2019, she gave a&nbsp;voice to&nbsp;Matilda in&nbsp;The Angry Birds Movie&nbsp;2. Rudolph has been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship with director Paul Thomas Anderson since 2001 and they have 4&nbsp;children together.</p><p>She has over 475,000 followers on&nbsp;her <a href=#>Instagram</a> account and publishes photos and videos about her life and performances there.</p><p><h2>11. Pomaika’i Brown as&nbsp;Nick</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e64/5dc/3b2b59579ea94ab499acb844bf.jpg><p>Pomaika’i Brown, who is&nbsp;59&nbsp;years old now, played the peculiar chef in&nbsp;50&nbsp;First Dates. However, his main profession is&nbsp;not that of&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor&nbsp;— he’s actually a&nbsp;musician. He&nbsp;began his musical career playing the ukulele as&nbsp;early as&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;12.</p><p><br>Currently, Brown and his wife Toni run their <a href=#>own</a> production company called Hollywood Brown Entertainment. They specialize in&nbsp;producing contemporary Polynesian music, television productions, and live folkloric shows for a&nbsp;very exclusive clientele.</p><p>Does this romantic comedy bring back any special memories for you?
