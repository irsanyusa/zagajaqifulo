He found work programming computers for a bank at night, and pursued a singing career by day. He possessed a wide vocal range, and fell into songwriting when improvising forgotten lyrics.</p><p>After working on demo recordings and releasing a few singles, and having The Monkees cover his song "Cuddly Toy", he signed a major label contract with RCA, and resigned from the bank. His early RCA albums were critical, if not commercial, successes, and caught the ear of Beatles press agent Derek Taylor. Soon after, <a href=#>Paul McCartney</a> and <a href=#>John Lennon</a> endorsed his work, and his career took off.</p><p>He did not enjoy performing, and never toured. Part of his recording process involved multi-tracking his own voice in a choral fashion, which could not be replicated on stage.</p><p>His biggest hit singles, both of which won Grammy Awards, were cover versions - Fred Neil's "Everbody's Talkin'" (from the film Midnight Cowboy) and Badfinger's "Without You" (on his career defining album Nilsson Schmilsson). As a songwriter, his biggest hit was by Three Dog Night covering "One".</p><p>The follow up work to his biggest success was decidedly less commercial, the album 'Son of Schmilsson' contained lyrics not suitable for broadcast, and then he made an orchestral album of torch song standards (A Touch of Schmilsson in the Night). His increased drink and drug usage began affecting him, and culminated with him working through severely injured vocal chords on his 'Pussycats' album, produced by John Lennon during his notorious 'lost weekend' in Los Angeles.</p><p>After Lennon's murder, Nilsson largely stopped making new music and became a gun control advocate. His musical output mostly concentrated on film soundtracks.</p><p>In 1976, he married for his third time, to Una O'Keefe, an Irish woman who was a student-waitress when they met at an ice cream parlor in New York City in 1973. With her, he had 6 of his 7 children.</p><p>Bankruptcy and a 1993 heart attack motivated him to get back to recording in order to support his family. He was working on an album when a second heart attack in 1994 ended his life. 25 years later, his finished vocals were given some backing music, and the album "Losst and Founnd" was released.</p><p>For the Love of Harry: Everybody Sings Nilsson, a tribute album featuring Nilsson's songs performed by <a href=#>Ringo Starr</a> and <a href=#>Stevie Nicks</a>, <a href=#>Brian Wilson</a>, Aimee Mann, Randy Newman, Jimmy Webb, and others, was released in 1995, with proceeds benefiting the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.</p><p>A documentary film," Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why Is Everybody Talkin' About Him)?" was produced in 2006.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>June 15</a>, <a href=#>1941</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Brooklyn, New York, USA</p><p class=info><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Silent Generation</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Snake</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Gemini</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>January 15</a>, <a href=#>1994</a> (aged 52)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> <a href=#>Heart attack</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Career Highlights</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1972-02-19</a> American singer Harry Nilsson's single "Without You" begins a 4 week run at the top of the charts.
