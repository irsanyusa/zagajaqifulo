post-container"><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ARIEL by Sylvia Plath. 85 pages. Harper & Row. $4.95.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On a dank day in February 1963, a pretty young mother of two children was found in a London flat with her head in the oven and the gas jets wide open. The dead woman was Sylvia Plath, 30, an American poet whose marriage to Ted Hughes, a British poet, had gone on the rocks not long before. Her published verses, appearing occasionally in American magazines and gathered in a single volume, The Colossus, had displayed accents of refinement, but had not yet achieved authority of tone.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But within a week of her death, intellectual London was hunched over copies of a strange and terrible poem she had written during her last sick slide toward suicide. Daddy was its title; its subject was her morbid love-hatred of her father; its style was as brutal as a truncheon. What is more, Daddy was merely the first jet of flame from a literary dragon who in the last months of her life breathed a burning river of bale across the literary landscape.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Published last year in Britain, the last poems of Sylvia Plath sold 15,000 copies in ten months, almost as many as a bestselling novel, and inspired a vigorous new group of confessional poets. Published last week in the U.S., Ariel adds a powerful voice to the rising chorus of American bards (Robert Lowell, Ann Sexton, Frederick Seidel) who practice poetry as abreaction.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Worms like Sticky Pearls. Outwardly, Sylvia’s psychosis has standard Freudian trimmings. Her father, born in the Polish town of Grabow in East Prussia, became a professor of entomology at Boston University and is presented in her poetry as an intellectual tyrant with “a love of the rack and the screw.” The mother of the heroine in The Bell Jar, an autobiographical novel published in England just before Sylvia’s death, is described as a metallic New England schoolmarm. Little Sylvia tried to be Daddy’s darling. At three she knew the Latin names of hundreds of insects—whenever a bumblebee bumbled by, the pretty little poppet would squeak: “Bombus bimaculatus!”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But when she was ten, Daddy died. It was the trauma of her life, or so she came to think in later years. At any rate, she became a compulsive talker, a compulsive learner, a compulsive writer. All through her teens she scribbled stories, plays, poems—many of them sufficiently professional to be published in Seventeen and Mademoiselle. She won a scholarship to Smith, where she made straight A’s. But her feelings took their revenge. At 19, after an unhappy month in New York City, she ran home to Wellesley, Mass., crawled under the front porch, hid behind a stack of kindling, and swallowed 50 sleeping pills. Three days later she was found, alive but in ghastly condition. “They had to call and call,” she wrote later, “and pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Words like Missiles. A series of shock treatments put her back on her feet, but she needed “to be bolstered by someone,” and a few years later she found that someone in Poet Hughes, whom she met during her Fulbright year at Cambridge. As a poet, Sylvia matured rapidly during her marriage; after the birth of her daughter Frieda, she found in the woman’s world the subject she could call her own.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Love set you going like a fat gold watch.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Took its place among the elements.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">AII night your moth-breath</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Flickers among the flat pink roses.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I wake to listen: A far sea moves in my ear.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In my Victorian nightgown.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Your mouth opens clean as a cat’s.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But life was more difficult than poetry. In the fall of 1962, just after the birth of her son Nicholas, she and Hughes separated permanently. Alone with the children in Devon, Sylvia hurled herself into a heroic but foolhardy attempt to probe her deepest problems with the point of a pen.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All day she kept house and cared for the children. Most of the night she wrote “like a woman on fire”—two, three, six complete poems night after night. Her fire was black and its name was hatred. Her words were hard and small like missiles, and they were flung with flat force.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now I break up in pieces that fly about like clubs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A wind of such violence</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Will tolerate no by standing: I must shriek.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But beneath the hatred she found fear.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I am terrified by this dark thing</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That sleeps in me;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All day I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What is this, this face</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So murderous in its strangle of branches?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And beneath the fear, she found a sinister love of death. She longed to feel the knife not carve, but enter</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pure and clean as the cry of a baby,</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And the universe slide from my side.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Death like a Poem. In her most ferocious poems, Daddy and Lady Lazarus, fear, hate, love, death and the poet’s own identity become fused at black heat with the figure of her father, and through him, with the guilt of the German exterminators and the suffering of their Jewish victims. They are poems, as Robert Lowell says in his preface to Ariel, that “play Russian roulette with six cartridges in the cylinder.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For six months, first in Devon and later in London, Sylvia wrote without letup. By the end of January 1963, her nerves were a shirt of nettles. On Feb. 4 she arrived at a friend’s house, lugging the children. “She was in an inferno,” the friend remembers. “Depression is not the word.” For six days she let herself be looked after, but on Feb. 10 she went back to her flat to spend the night. The next morning, in an Auschwitz all her own, she executed what one critic calls her “last unwritten poem.” The epithet is appropriate. In the last week of her life she laid bare the heart of her art in a clouting couplet:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The blood jet is poetry; There is no stopping it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">DADDY</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You do not do, you do not do Any more, black shoe In which I have lived like a foot For thirty years, poor and white. Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Daddy, I have had to kill you. You died before I had time—Marble-heavy, a bag full of God, Ghastly statue with one grey toe Big as a Frisco seal</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And a head in the freakish Atlantic Where it pours bean green over blue In the waters off beautiful Nauset. I used to pray to recover you. Ach, du.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the German tongue, in the Polish town Scraped flat by the roller Of wars, wars, wars. But the name of the town is common. My Polack friend</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Says there are a dozen or two. So I never could tell where you Put your foot, your root, I never could talk to you. The tongue stuck in my jaw.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It stuck in a barb wire snare. Ich, ich, ich, ich,</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I could hardly speak. I thought every German was you. And the language obscene</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">An engine, an engine Chuffing me off like a Jew. A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen. I began to talk like a Jew. I think I may well be a Jew.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna Are not very pure or true. With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack I may be a bit of a Jew.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I have always been scared of you, With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo. And your neat moustache And your Aryan eye, bright blue. Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You—</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Not God but a swastika So black no sky could squeak through. Every woman adores a Fascist, The boot in the face, the brute Brute heart of a brute like you.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You stand at the blackboard, daddy, In the picture I have of you, A cleft in your chin instead of your foot But no less a devil for that, no not Any less the black man who</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bit my pretty red heart in two. I was ten when they buried you. At twenty I tried to die And get back, back, back to you. I thought even the bones would do.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But they pulled me out of the sack, And they stuck me together with glue. And then I knew what to do. I made a model of you, A man in black with a Meinkampf look</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And a love of the rack and the screw. And I said I do, I do. So daddy, I’m finally through. The black telephone’s off at the root, The voices just can’t worm through.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If I’ve killed one man, I’ve killed two—The vampire who said he was you And drank my blood for a year, Seven years, if you want to know. Daddy, you can lie back now.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s a stake in your fat black heart And the villagers never liked you. They are dancing and stamping on you. They always knew it was you. Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I’m through.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9vcG1han9wrs6ooqxlpJ2ybq7LqKadZZqawW610manqJ2kp8Zw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./heidi-klum-posts-pda-filled-vacation-pictures-with-tom-kaulitz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heidi Klum Posts PDA-Filled Vacation Pictures With Tom Kaulitz">&larr;
