He gave himself the nickname “the Prince of Pain” and produced acclaimed comedy specials throughout the 1980s with titles including “I’m in Pain,” “I’m Exhausted,” and “I’m Doomed.” After becoming sober in the ’90s, Lewis published a memoir, The Other Great Depression: How I’m Overcoming, on a Daily Basis, at Least a Million Addictions and Dysfunctions and Finding a Spiritual (Sometimes) Life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As an actor, Lewis was originally best known for his roles in the 1989 ABC sitcom Anything but Love, starring opposite Jamie Lee Curtis, and in Mel Brooks’ 1993 film Robin Hood: Men in Tights, in which he played Prince John. But Lewis’ popularity surged in the 2000s after he began playing a version of himself in <a href=#>Larry David’s HBO sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/richard-lewis-larry-david-curb-your-enthusiasm.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lewis’ passing has opened a floodgate of moving tributes and remembrances from former castmates and other friends across Hollywood and beyond.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Richard and I were born three days apart in the same hospital and for most of my life he’s been like a brother to me,” David said in a statement after Lewis’ death. “He had that rare combination of being the funniest person and also the sweetest. But today he made me sob and for that I’ll never forgive him.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Screenwriter and director Robert B. Weide, who produced the first five seasons of Curb, posted on X (formerly Twitter) photos of him and Lewis over the years. “Reeling from the news. The suddenness of it. I love you, Pal. Always have. Always will,” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Curtis</a>, Lewis’ Anything but Love co-star, took to Instagram to express her grief, sharing a gallery of photos of them together together on set alongside a message saying: “Rest in laughter, Richard.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Cheryl Hines</a>, who played David’s wife on Curb, posted that Lewis was “one of the most loving people I know” and “would take time to tell the people he loved what they meant to him. … To be loved by Richard Lewis. A true gift.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Susie Essman</a>, another co-star from Curb, called Lewis “an original brilliant voice that can not be replaced.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Besides your remarkable talent there was no one sweeter or more generous than you,” Lewis’ Robin Hood co-star <a href=#>Cary Elwes</a> posted on X.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Noooo….. We were literally just making plans to get together. Besides your remarkable talent there was no one sweeter or more generous than you, my friend. I miss you already & forever. Rest in Power, Richard.

He was so funny. And deep,” said <a href=#>Ben Stiller</a>. “As a kid i remember seeing him at the Improv and how nice he was to me and my sister. Over the years he would always reach out with support and love or a kind word - sometimes out of the blue. It always felt special to hear from him.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I never met a kinder, more empathetic comedy genius. He was so funny. And deep. As a stand up he was really iconic in the 70s.

RL: ‘Thanks. You a comic?’ me: ‘no, just open mics’ RL: ‘Do you go on stage?’ me: ‘yeah’ RL: ‘Do you tell jokes?’ me: ‘yeah’&nbsp; RL: ‘Then you’re a comic.’ He could’ve just said thanks and left. Never forgot it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“First time I saw Richard Lewis perform was at Carnegie Hall in Dec 1989,” stand-up comedian and actor <a href=#>Jeffrey Ross</a> wrote on Instagram. “I was just an aspiring comic in the crowd and Richard’s performance showed me that you don’t have to play guitar or write songs to be a rockstar.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I will be lost without our daily phone calls,” said folk singer-songwriter and musician <a href=#>Todd Snider</a>, who shared a close friendship and mutual admiration of each other with Lewis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Canadian comedian <a href=#>David Steinberg</a> wrote on Instagram: “Richard you were one of a kind. The best kind. I treasure our friendship over the years. I love you and I will miss you.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sports and news commentator <a href=#>Keith Olbermann</a> shared: “I have never had a brother. From the day he came up and said hi in 1989 Richard Lewis and I called each other ‘brother.’ I used to kid him: if people knew how good and kind a person he was, it would ruin his career. He will always be with me.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Wednesday’s Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon took a moment to honor Lewis’ passing, recalling how he used to impersonate the late comedian. “He was a good friend of the show, a great guest,” Fallon said. “I think he was one of the greatest comedians to ever do it. … He was unbelievable.”</p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jimmy Kimmel Live! <a href=#>host Jimmy Kimmel and guest Bob Odenkirk</a> similarly paid their respects to Lewis, who Odenkirk called a “great, great, stand-up comic” who was “in touch with everybody.” Both Odenkirk and Kimmel said they had just been texting with Lewis in recent days. “We always have him to thank for that very personal [type of] comedy that he blazed the trail of,” Odenkirk said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Rex Chapman</a>, NBA veteran and social media personality known for his openness about his own recovery from addiction and path to self-acceptance, said on X that he and Lewis became friends through Twitter and that Lewis “would send friendly little messages from time to time over the past few years while he battled health issues. What a guy. Rest in peace, Richard.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And Ellen DeGeneres Show producer <a href=#>Andy Lassner</a> detailed on Instagram how the late comedian was persistent in helping him overcome addiction: “He was the menschiest of mensches. And I guess what I want to say is he was one of the many angels in my life who saved me. And my regret today is not staying in touch. Life is fleeting. Stay connected.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Podcast host and comedian <a href=#>Doug Benson</a> remembered Lewis as a personal inspiration. “His encouragement was the push I needed to keep going in a field that can be not encouraging at all.”&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Very sad day. Richard Lewis was not only one of the great comics who inspired me to try stand-up, he was also very nice to me when I met him in the early days of my career. His encouragement was the push I needed to keep going in a field that can be not encouraging at all.

He was kind.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Patton Oswalt</a> and <a href=#>Paula Poundstone</a> simply shared photos.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“So much legacy comedy you have left here,” said <a href=#>Tim Allen</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Adam Carolla</a> called Lewis, “One of the greatest, most talented men I’ve ever met.” <a href=#>Dane Cook</a> called him “a champion.” <a href=#>Loni Love</a> called him “the best … lovely, hilarious and authentic.” <a href=#>Michael McKean</a> called him “a very good man.” And director <a href=#>Paul Feig</a> called Lewis his “hero.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Sleep well Richard,” Daily Show host <a href=#>Jon Stewart</a>, who had Lewis as a guest several times on his Comedy Central show and was frequently said to physically resemble the fellow comedian, quipped, “I’ll try to take good care of our face.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcGNrf3R%2FjqugnKCRp7FuuMSwoKxlpKe2o8HTnqpmm6Wnr27Fzq6pZp2eqbW2v8iaqqZlk6S6prDImqVmpJWcrqTFjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jim-steinman-lena-hall-bat-out-of-hell-appreciation-1234958463.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bat Out of Hell Star Lena Hall on the Genius of Jim Steinman, a Writer Who Saw No Distin">&larr;
