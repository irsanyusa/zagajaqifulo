Cash advance apps make it possible to access relatively small portions of your own pay ahead of time: Users borrow money, usually on the order of $10 to $500, for the short term, which is usually automatically withdrawn from their linked bank account when their next paycheck hits.</p><p>So how do cash advance apps make money? These days, most are tied to larger money management platforms and budgeting tools that come with monthly membership fees—and if you want to get access to your advance fast, you may pay hefty express delivery fees as well.

We chose best-of categories for each of these apps based on their unique features and which target demographics they might best serve.</p><h2 id=how-to-select-a-cash-advance-app>How to select a cash advance app</h2><p>With so many cash advance apps on the market, it can be difficult to discern which one is right for you. Here are some features to keep in mind while you shop for your next cash advance.</p><h3>Advance maximum</h3><p>One of the most important considerations when choosing a cash advance app is how much money you actually need from the advance to meet your financial goals. If you need a larger advance, you will be limited to the apps that offer more substantial advance maximums. For just a few dollars, your range of options may be wider.</p><h3>Fees</h3><p>Spoiler alert: All cash advance apps are for-profit companies, and they all need to make money. One way that many of them do so is through charging monthly membership fees—either to access the cash advance itself or to maintain an account with the company, often tied to money management tools like a budgeting app or spending and savings accounts.</p><p>Always be sure you read all the fine print before choosing your cash advance app so you know how much money you’ll pay for the service of the advance itself—and how much you may be locked into on an ongoing basis.</p><h3>Additional functionalities</h3><p>Some people are simply looking for quick cash, while others may be in need of a more holistic “home base” for their finances including expense tracking, budgeting functionalities, and even an investment platform. Depending on your needs, different apps will appeal to you based on how many additional functionalities they build in. Again, just keep an eye out for monthly membership fees.</p><h2 id=alternatives-to-cash-advance-apps>Alternatives to cash advance apps</h2><p>While cash advance apps can help in a pinch, if you’re in need of quick cash, there are other options to consider that may make more sense depending on your circumstances.</p><h3>Credit cards</h3><p>While even the best credit cards often come with double-digit interest rates (which will be listed in your credit card agreement as APR), if you pay off your balance in full each and every month, you’ll never pay interest on your purchases. What’s more, you may already have a credit card available, avoiding the need to sign up for a new cash advance app and its attendant monthly membership fee. That said, falling into high-interest credit card debt is all too easy. If you can’t pay off the balance in full each month, you need to proceed with caution. We therefore recommend <a rel=alternate href=#>credit cards with 0% APR interest</a>, up to a number of months.</p><h3>Personal loans</h3><p>Personal, unsecured loans don’t require collateral (unlike, say, mortgage loans or auto loans). For that reason, they can generally be used to pay for just about anything. If you need a larger amount of money than cash advance apps offer, a <a rel=alternate href=#>personal loan</a> might be your best bet. Again, beware of high interest rates—and more stringent qualification requirements. (Almost all personal loans require a credit check, unlike cash advance apps.)</p><h3>Emergency savings</h3><p>Ideally, emergency funds should come from an <a rel=alternate href=#>emergency savings account</a> that you’ve built up over time. (In a truly ideal world, that account has some three to six months’ worth of living expenses for you to draw from in case of a true financial crisis.) Of course, the world we live in is not ideal. If you, like many Americans, are living paycheck-to-paycheck, perhaps this is a good time to start stashing away toward this goal. Even a small savings habit builds up over time, especially if you’re consistent.</p><h2 id=more-on-credit-cash-advance-apps>More on credit cash advance apps</h2><p>Curious to know more about cash advance apps? Here’s the scoop.</p><h3>What is a cash advance app?</h3><p>A cash advance app is an app or web platform that offers short-term loans designed to tide users over until payday. In many instances, the loan amount is automatically withdrawn from your bank account, or “settled,” the day your next paycheck hits your account.</p><p>Cash advance apps often allow users to access cash advances without credit checks, interest, or late fees, but may come with monthly membership fees to access their money management tools, spending accounts, or simply to have your account open at all.</p><h3>What are the pros and cons of cash apps?</h3><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Cash advance apps allow you to access money you’ve already earned ahead of time—and unlike personal loans, they don’t come with interest charges.</li><li>Cash advance apps make it easy for almost anyone to qualify since they typically don’t require a credit check.</li><li>Cash advance apps often come with additional functionalities that can make money management easier for users, such as budgeting tools and expense tracking.</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Although the advance itself is free, cash advance apps often automatically enroll users in their large financial management platform, which may come with hefty monthly fees—sometimes as high as $19.99 per month.</li><li>Advances may take several days to hit your bank account. Cash advance apps often leverage this fact to charge expedited delivery fees that eat significantly into the advance itself. (For instance, even FloatMe’s relatively low $5 fee is for its $50 “float,” which accounts for 10% of the overall advance.)</li><li>In some instances, fees may not be transparent to users during sign up. It’s important to read the fine print.</li><li>Automatic settlement from your bank account may cause overdrafts if your paycheck is late (or the settlement date is miscalculated).</li><li>Cash advance apps may charge an additional fee to transfer the advance to an external, existing bank account. Avoiding that fee keeps you within their ecosystem to spend the money you borrowed with a proprietary account.</li></ul><h3>How do cash advance apps work?</h3><p>Cash advance apps leverage your upcoming paycheck to allow you to access smaller amounts of money—usually between $10 and $500—before payday. Once your next payday arrives, the amount is often automatically withdrawn from your linked bank account. However, you may also be subject to expedited transfer fees or an ongoing monthly membership fee.</p><h3>Are cash apps payday lenders?</h3><p>Because cash advance apps leverage your upcoming paycheck to lend you money, they are similar to payday lenders—but they aren’t technically issuing you a loan. Many cash advance apps are not technically banks or financial institutions, though they may be partnered with banks, and advances are not the same as loans.</p><h3>How do I best use cash advance apps?</h3><p>Cash advance apps are best used if you need only a small amount of money that you know your next paycheck will cover—and if you can find an app that doesn’t charge high fees for external or expedited transfers. If, on the other hand, you’re looking for an all-inclusive money management platform, and you’re willing to pay a monthly membership, it may make more sense to find the platform that works best for you first—and scope out its cash advance products from there.</p><h2 id=time-stamp-cash-advance-apps-can-help-in-a-pinch>TIME Stamp: Cash advance apps can help in a pinch</h2><p>While drawing from a robust emergency fund is the best way to cover an unexpected expense, cash advance apps can be a lower-cost alternative to personal loans or high-interest credit cards. However, keep in mind that monthly membership fees may apply—and may be high enough to cost well over $100 per year if you don’t cancel.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is the easiest app to get a cash advance?</h3><p>There are a wide variety of cash advance apps on the market today, and most make the advance process as easy as entering your demographic information and linking your bank account. (Few require a credit check to qualify.) However, delivery times vary, and it may be as long as several days before the advance hits your bank account—unless you pay express transfer delivery fees that can eat substantially into your advance. It’s worth shopping around for the lowest fees possible.</p><h3>Which money app gives you money instantly?</h3><p>Apps like Klover, Brigit, Dave, Empower, FloatMe, and many others offer instant access to cash advances from your upcoming paycheck. The cash will be settled, or paid back, from your bank account once your next paycheck hits.</p><h3>Which app gives you a $1,000 loan?</h3><p>None of the cash advance apps we analyzed have a maximum as high as $1,000. EarnIn offers users the opportunity to take out up to $750 per pay period in cash advances, and several of the apps have maximums of $500.</p><h3>Which cash advance apps work with Cash App?</h3><p>Cash advance apps are constantly evolving, and new ones come out all the time.
